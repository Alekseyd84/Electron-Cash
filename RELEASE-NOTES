Electrum Cash is a fork of the open source Electrum Bitcoin wallet, to be operable for Bitcoin Cash.  

This software is not affiliated, associated, or endorsed by Electrum, electrum.org or any electrum developers.

Electrum 2.9 contains bugs and apparently unfinished code dealing with chain forks that may cause strange behavior such as the number of confirmations to be wrong.  Because this package forks that code, this software may also contain those bugs.

Electrum Cash's main modifications are changes for SPV headers for Electrum Cash difficulty algo, and the new SIGHASH_FORKID transaction type.  Default servers have been modified also, and replace-by-fee has been removed from the gui.
